# 8. Memory Consistency Model

In multi-threaded executions, the side-effects of memory operations performed by each thread become visible to other threads in a partial and non-identical order. This means that any two operations may appear to happen in no order, or in different orders, to different threads. The axioms introduced by the memory consistency model specify exactly which contradictions are forbidden between the orders observed by different threads.

In the absence of any constraint, each read operation returns the value committed by some write operation to the same memory location, including the initial write to that memory location. The memory consistency model effectively constrains the set of such candidate writes from which a read operation can return a value.

<a id="scope-and-applicability"></a>
## 8.1. Scope and applicability of the model

The constraints specified under this model apply to PTX programs with any PTX ISA version number, running on `sm_70` or later architectures.

The memory consistency model does not apply to texture (including `ld.global.nc`) and surface accesses.

<a id="limitations-system-scope-atomicity"></a>
### 8.1.1. Limitations on atomicity at system scope

When communicating with the host CPU, certain strong operations with system scope may not be performed atomically on some systems. For more details on atomicity guarantees to host memory, see the *CUDA Atomicity Requirements*.

<a id="memory-operations"></a>
## 8.2. Memory operations

The fundamental storage unit in the PTX memory model is a byte, consisting of 8 bits. Each state space available to a PTX program is a sequence of contiguous bytes in memory. Every byte in a PTX state space has a unique address relative to all threads that have access to the same state space.

Each PTX memory instruction specifies an address operand and a data type. The address operand contains a virtual address that gets converted to a physical address during memory access. The physical address and the size of the data type together define a physical memory location, which is the range of bytes starting from the physical address and extending up to the size of the data type in bytes. Analogously, the address operand together with the size of the data type define the range of virtual memory addresses accessed by the memory operation.

The memory consistency model specification uses the terms “address” or “memory address” to indicate a virtual address, and the term “memory location” to indicate a physical memory location.

Each PTX memory instruction also specifies the operation — either a read, a write or an atomic read-modify-write — to be performed on all the bytes in the corresponding memory location.

<a id="overlap"></a>
### 8.2.1. Overlap

Two memory locations are said to overlap when the starting address of one location is within the range of bytes constituting the other location. Two memory operations are said to overlap when the range of virtual addresses accessed by the two operations intersect. The overlap is said to be complete when both memory locations are identical, and it is said to be partial otherwise.

<a id="aliases"></a>
### 8.2.2. Aliases

Two distinct virtual addresses are said to be aliases if they map to the same memory location.

<a id="multimem-addresses"></a>
### 8.2.3. Multimem Addresses

A multimem address is a virtual address which points to multiple distinct memory locations across devices.

Only *multimem.*\* operations are valid on multimem addresses. That is, the behavior of accessing a multimem address in any other memory operation is undefined.

<a id="memory-operations-on-vector-data-types"></a>
### 8.2.4. Memory Operations on Vector Data Types

The memory consistency model relates operations executed on memory locations with scalar data types, which have a maximum size and alignment of 64 bits. Memory operations with a vector data type are modelled as a set of equivalent memory operations with a scalar data type, executed in an unspecified order on the elements in the vector.

<a id="memory-operations-on-packed-data-types"></a>
### 8.2.5. Memory Operations on Packed Data Types

A packed data type consists of two values of the same scalar data type, as described in [Packed Data Types](05-state-spaces-types-and-variables.md#packed-data-types). These values are accessed in adjacent memory locations. A memory operation on a packed data type is modelled as a pair of equivalent memory operations on the scalar data type, executed in an unspecified order on each element of the packed data.

<a id="initialization"></a>
### 8.2.6. Initialization

Each byte in memory is initialized by a hypothetical write *W0* executed before starting any thread in the program. If the byte is included in a program variable, and that variable has an initial value, then *W0* writes the corresponding initial value for that byte; else *W0* is assumed to have written an unknown but constant value to the byte.

<a id="memory-consistency-state-spaces"></a>
## 8.3. State spaces

The relations defined in the memory consistency model are independent of state spaces. In particular, causality order closes over all memory operations across all the state spaces. But the side-effect of a memory operation in one state space can be observed directly only by operations that also have access to the same state space. This further constrains the synchronizing effect of a memory operation in addition to scope. For example, the synchronizing effect of the PTX instruction `ld.relaxed.shared.sys` is identical to that of `ld.relaxed.shared.cluster`, since no thread outside the same cluster can execute an operation that accesses the same memory location.

<a id="operation-types"></a>
## 8.4. Operation types

For simplicity, the rest of the document refers to the following operation types, instead of mentioning specific instructions that give rise to them.

| Operation Type | Instruction/Operation |
|----|----|
| atomic operation | `atom` or `red` instruction. |
| read operation | All variants of `ld` instruction and `atom` instruction (but not `red` instruction). |
| write operation | All variants of `st` instruction, and *atomic* operations if they result in a write. |
| memory operation | A *read* or *write* operation. |
| volatile operation | An instruction with `.volatile` qualifier. |
| acquire operation | A *memory* operation with `.acquire` or `.acq_rel` qualifier. |
| release operation | A *memory* operation with `.release` or `.acq_rel` qualifier. |
| mmio operation | An `ld` or `st` instruction with `.mmio` qualifier. |
| memory fence operation | A `membar`, `fence.sc` or `fence.acq_rel` instruction. |
| proxy fence operation | A `fence.proxy` or a `membar.proxy` instruction. |
| strong operation | A *memory fence* operation, or a *memory* operation with a `.relaxed`, `.acquire`, `.release`, `.acq_rel`, `.volatile`, or `.mmio` qualifier. |
| weak operation | An `ld` or `st` instruction with a `.weak` qualifier. |
| synchronizing operation | A `barrier` instruction, *fence* operation, *release* operation or *acquire* operation. |

Table 20 Operation Types[](#id742 "Permalink to this table") {#id742}

<a id="mmio-operation"></a>
### 8.4.1. mmio Operation

An *mmio* operation is a memory operation with `.mmio` qualifier specified. It is usually performed on a memory location which is mapped to the control registers of peer I/O devices. It can also be used for communication between threads but has poor performance relative to non-*mmio* operations.

The semantic meaning of *mmio* operations cannot be defined precisely as it is defined by the underlying I/O device. For formal specification of semantics of *mmio* operation from Memory Consistency Model perspective, it is equivalent to the semantics of a *strong* operation. But it follows a few implementation-specific properties, if it meets the *CUDA atomicity requirements* at the specified scope:

- Writes are always performed and are never combined within the scope specified.

- Reads are always performed, and are not forwarded, prefetched, combined, or allowed to hit any cache within the scope specified.

  - As an exception, in some implementations, the surrounding locations may also be loaded. In such cases the amount of data loaded is implementation specific and varies between 32 and 128 bytes in size.

<a id="volatile-operation"></a>
### 8.4.2. volatile Operation

A *volatile* operation is a memory operation with `.volatile` qualifier specified. The semantics of volatile operations are equivalent to a relaxed memory operation with system-scope but with the following extra implementation-specific constraints:

- The number of volatile *instructions* (not operations) executed by a program is preserved. Hardware may combine and merge volatile *operations* issued by multiple different volatile *instructions*, that is, the number of volatile *operations* in the program is not preserved.

- Volatile *instructions* are not re-ordered around other volatile *instructions*, but the memory *operations* performed by those *instructions* may be re-ordered around each other.

Note

PTX volatile operations are intended for compilers to lower volatile read and write operations from CUDA C++, and other programming languages sharing CUDA C++ volatile semantics, to PTX.

Since volatile operations are relaxed at system-scope with extra constraints, prefer using other *strong* read or write operations (e.g. `ld.relaxed.sys` or `st.relaxed.sys`) for **Inter-Thread Synchronization** instead, which may deliver better performance.

PTX volatile operations are not suited for **Memory Mapped IO (MMIO)** because volatile operations do not preserve the number of memory operations performed, and may perform more or less operations than requested in a non-deterministic way. Use [.mmio operations](#mmio-operation) instead, which strictly preserve the number of operations performed.

<a id="scope"></a>
## 8.5. Scope

Each *strong* operation must specify a *scope*, which is the set of threads that may interact directly with that operation and establish any of the relations described in the memory consistency model. There are four scopes:

| Scope | Description |
|----|----|
| `.cta` | The set of all threads executing in the same CTA as the current thread. |
| `.cluster` | The set of all threads executing in the same cluster as the current thread. |
| `.gpu` | The set of all threads in the current program executing on the same compute device as the current thread. This also includes other kernel grids invoked by the host program on the same compute device. |
| `.sys` | The set of all threads in the current program, including all kernel grids invoked by the host program on all compute devices, and all threads constituting the host program itself. |

Table 21 Scopes[](#id743 "Permalink to this table") {#id743}

Note that the warp is not a *scope*; the CTA is the smallest collection of threads that qualifies as a *scope* in the memory consistency model.

<a id="proxies"></a>
## 8.6. Proxies

A *memory proxy*, or a *proxy* is an abstract label applied to a method of memory access. When two memory operations use distinct methods of memory access, they are said to be different *proxies*.

A *proxy fence* is required to synchronize memory operations across different *proxies*. Although virtual aliases use the *generic* method of memory access, since using distinct virtual addresses behaves as if using different *proxies*, they require a *proxy fence* to establish memory ordering.

Unless otherwise specified, memory operations as defined in [Operation types](#operation-types) use *generic* method of memory access, i.e. a *generic proxy*. Operations using methods of access distinct from the *generic* method include:

- textures and surface accesses,

- accesses to the same location via the same proxy using distinct virtual memory addresses,

- async-proxy and tensormap-proxy accesses by .async.bulk operations,

- fabric-proxy accesses by fabric operations,

- readonly-proxy accesses by `ld.proxy::readonly` operations.

The *readonly proxy* may be used to load read-only data. Refer to [Data Movement and Conversion Instructions: ld](instructions/10-data-movement-and-conversion-instructions/08-ld.md#data-movement-and-conversion-instructions-ld) for details.

<a id="strong-proxy-accesses"></a>
### 8.6.1. Strong Proxy Accesses

Strong modifications through

- generic-proxy,

- async-proxy,

- tensormap-proxy,

- fabric-proxy,

eventually become observable by strong accesses to the same location performed via a different proxy in that list, if modification and access are:

- system-scope - even if these used distinct memory addresses - or

- gpu-scope if the different proxies involved are in the following list:

  - async-proxy,

  - generic-proxy.

<a id="morally-strong-operations"></a>
## 8.7. Morally strong operations

Two operations are said to be *morally strong* relative to each other if they satisfy all of the following conditions:

1.  The operations are related in *program order* (i.e, they are both executed by the same thread), or each operation is *strong* and specifies a *scope* that includes the thread executing the other operation.

2.  Both operations are performed via the same *proxy*.

3.  If both are memory operations, then they overlap completely.

Most (but not all) of the axioms in the memory consistency model depend on relations between *morally strong* operations.

<a id="conflict-and-data-races"></a>
### 8.7.1. Conflict and Data-races

Two *overlapping* memory operations are said to *conflict* when at least one of them is a *write*.

Two *conflicting* memory operations are said to be in a *data-race* if they are not related in *causality order* and they are not *morally strong*.

<a id="mixed-size-limitations"></a>
### 8.7.2. Limitations on Mixed-size Data-races

A *data-race* between operations that *overlap* completely is called a *uniform-size data-race*, while a *data-race* between operations that *overlap* partially is called a *mixed-size data-race*.

The axioms in the memory consistency model do not apply if a PTX program contains one or more *mixed-size data-races*. But these axioms are sufficient to describe the behavior of a PTX program with only *uniform-size data-races*.

Atomicity of mixed-size RMW operations

In any program with or without *mixed-size data-races*, the following property holds for every pair of *overlapping atomic* operations A1 and A2 such that each specifies a *scope* that includes the other: Either the *read-modify-write* operation specified by A1 is performed completely before A2 is initiated, or vice versa. This property holds irrespective of whether the two operations A1 and A2 overlap partially or completely.

<a id="release-acquire-patterns"></a>
## 8.8. Release and Acquire Patterns

Some sequences of instructions give rise to patterns that participate in memory synchronization as described later. The *release* pattern makes prior operations from the current thread¹ visible to some operations from other threads. The *acquire* pattern makes some operations from other threads visible to later operations from the current thread.

A *release* pattern on a location M consists of one of the following:

1.  A *release* operation on M

    E.g.: `st.release`` ``[M];` or `atom.release`` ``[M];` or `mbarrier.arrive.release`` ``[M];`

2.  Or a *release* or *acquire-release* operation on M followed by a *strong* write on M in *program order*

    E.g.: `st.release`` ``[M]`; `st.relaxed`` ``[M];`

3.  Or a *release* or *acquire-release* *memory fence* followed by a *strong* write on M in *program order*

    E.g.: `fence.release;`` ``st.relaxed`` ``[M];` or `fence.release;`` ``atom.relaxed`` ``[M];`

4.  Or a *release* or *acquire-release memory fence* followed in *program order* by an asynchronous operation that performs a *strong* write on M

    E.g.: `fence.release;`` ``cp.async.bulk.global.shared.relaxed.sys.b128`` ``[M];`

5.  Or a *release* asynchronous operation that performs a *strong* write on M

    E.g.: `st.async.release.sys`` ``[M];`

Any *memory synchronization* established by a *release* pattern only affects operations occurring in *program order* before the first instruction in that pattern.

An *acquire* pattern on a location M consists of one of the following:

1.  An *acquire* operation on M

    E.g.: `ld.acquire`` ``[M];` or `atom.acquire`` ``[M];` or `mbarrier.test_wait.acquire`` ``[M];`

2.  Or a *strong* read on M followed by an *acquire* operation on M in *program order*

    E.g.: `ld.relaxed`` ``[M];`` ``ld.acquire`` ``[M];`

3.  Or a *strong* read on M followed by an acquire *memory fence* in *program order*

    E.g.: `ld.relaxed`` ``[M];`` ``fence.acquire;` or `atom.relaxed`` ``[M];`` ``fence.acquire;`

4.  Or first observing completion of an asynchronous operation that performs a *strong* read on M and then this observation is followed by an *acquire* memory fence in *program order*

    E.g.: `cp.async.bulk.mbarrier::complete_tx::bytes.relaxed.sys.b128`` ``[dst],`` ``[M],`` ``size,`` ``[barrier];` // strong read on M `mbarrier.try_wait.relaxed`` ``p,`` ``[barrier];` // observes completion of async op that performs strong read on M `@p`` ``fence.acquire;` // acquire fence in program order after observing completion

Any *memory synchronization* established by an *acquire* pattern only affects operations occurring in *program order* after the last instruction in that pattern.

Note that while atomic reductions conceptually perform a strong read as part of its read-modify-write sequence, this strong read does not form an acquire pattern.

> E.g.: `red.add`` ``[M],`` ``1;`` ``fence.acquire;` is not an acquire pattern.

¹ For both *release* and *acquire* patterns, this effect is further extended to operations in other threads through the transitive nature of *causality order*.

<a id="ordering-memory-operations"></a>
## 8.9. Ordering of memory operations

The sequence of operations performed by each thread is captured as *program order* while *memory synchronization* across threads is captured as *causality order*. The visibility of the side-effects of memory operations to other memory operations is captured as *communication order*. The memory consistency model defines contradictions that are disallowed between communication order on the one hand, and *causality order* and *program order* on the other.

<a id="program-order"></a>
### 8.9.1. Program Order

The *program order* relates all operations performed by a thread to the order in which a sequential processor will execute instructions in the corresponding PTX source. It is a transitive relation that forms a total order over the operations performed by the thread, but does not relate operations from different threads.

<a id="program-order-async-operations"></a>
#### 8.9.1.1. Asynchronous Operations

Some PTX instructions (all variants of `cp.async`, `cp.async.bulk`, `cp.reduce.async.bulk`, `wgmma.mma_async`) perform operations that are asynchronous to the thread that executed the instruction. These asynchronous operations are ordered after prior instructions in the same thread (except in the case of `wgmma.mma_async`), but they are not part of the program order for that thread. Instead, they provide weaker ordering guarantees as documented in the instruction description.

For example, the loads and stores performed as part of a `cp.async` are ordered with respect to each other, but not to those of any other `cp.async` instructions initiated by the same thread, nor any other instruction subsequently issued by the thread with the exception of `cp.async.commit_group` or `cp.async.mbarrier.arrive`. The asynchronous mbarrier [arrive-on](instructions/15-parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions/16-mbarrier.md#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-arrive-on) operation performed by a `cp.async.mbarrier.arrive` instruction is ordered with respect to the memory operations performed by all prior `cp.async` operations initiated by the same thread, but not to those of any other instruction issued by the thread. The implicit mbarrier [complete-tx](instructions/15-parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions/16-mbarrier.md#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-complete-tx-operation) operation that is part of all variants of `cp.async.bulk` and `cp.reduce.async.bulk` instructions is ordered only with respect to the memory operations performed by the same asynchronous instruction, and in particular it does not transitively establish ordering with respect to prior instructions from the issuing thread.

<a id="observation-order"></a>
### 8.9.2. Observation Order

*Observation order* relates a write W to a read R through an optional sequence of atomic read-modify-write operations.

A write W precedes a read R in *observation order* if:

1.  R and W are *morally strong* and R reads the value written by W, or

2.  For some atomic operation Z, W precedes Z and Z precedes R in *observation order*.

<a id="fence-sc-order"></a>
### 8.9.3. Fence-SC Order

The *Fence-SC* order is an acyclic partial order, determined at runtime, that relates every pair of *morally strong fence.sc* operations.

<a id="memory-synchronization"></a>
### 8.9.4. Memory synchronization

Synchronizing operations performed by different threads synchronize with each other at runtime as described here. The effect of such synchronization is to establish *causality order* across threads.

1.  A `fence.sc` operation X *synchronizes* with a `fence.sc` operation Y if X precedes Y in the *Fence-SC* order.

2.  A `bar{.cta}.sync` or `bar{.cta}.red` or `bar{.cta}.arrive` operation *synchronizes* with a `bar{.cta}.sync` or `bar{.cta}.red` operation executed on the same barrier.

3.  A `barrier.cluster.arrive` operation synchronizes with a `barrier.cluster.wait` operation.

4.  A *release* pattern X *synchronizes* with an *acquire* pattern Y, if a *write* operation in X precedes a *read* operation in Y in *observation order*, and the first operation in X and the last operation in Y are *morally strong*.

API synchronization

A *synchronizes* relation can also be established by certain CUDA APIs.

1.  Completion of a task enqueued in a CUDA stream *synchronizes* with the start of the following task in the same stream, if any.

2.  For purposes of the above, recording or waiting on a CUDA event in a stream, or causing a cross-stream barrier to be inserted due to `cudaStreamLegacy`, enqueues tasks in the associated streams even if there are no direct side effects. An event record task *synchronizes* with matching event wait tasks, and a barrier arrival task *synchronizes* with matching barrier wait tasks.

3.  Start of a CUDA kernel *synchronizes* with start of all threads in the kernel. End of all threads in a kernel *synchronize* with end of the kernel.

4.  Start of a CUDA graph *synchronizes* with start of all source nodes in the graph. Completion of all sink nodes in a CUDA graph *synchronizes* with completion of the graph. Completion of a graph node *synchronizes* with start of all nodes with a direct dependency.

5.  Start of a CUDA API call to enqueue a task *synchronizes* with start of the task.

6.  Completion of the last task queued to a stream, if any, *synchronizes* with return from `cudaStreamSynchronize`. Completion of the most recently queued matching event record task, if any, *synchronizes* with return from `cudaEventSynchronize`. Synchronizing a CUDA device or context behaves as if synchronizing all streams in the context, including ones that have been destroyed.

7.  Returning `cudaSuccess` from an API to query a CUDA handle, such as a stream or event, behaves the same as return from the matching synchronization API.

In addition to establishing a *synchronizes* relation, the CUDA API synchronization mechanisms above also participate in *proxy-preserved base causality order* except for the *tensormap-proxy* which is not acquired from *generic-proxy* at CUDA Kernel start and must therefore be acquired explicitly using `fence.proxy.tensormap::generic.acquire` when needed.

<a id="causality-order"></a>
### 8.9.5. Causality Order

*Causality order* captures how memory operations become visible across threads through synchronizing operations. The axiom “Causality” uses this order to constrain the set of write operations from which a read operation may read a value.

Relations in the *causality order* primarily consist of relations in *Base causality order*¹ , which is a transitive order, determined at runtime.

Base causality order

An operation X precedes an operation Y in *base causality order* if:

1.  X precedes Y in *program order*, or

2.  X *synchronizes* with Y, or

3.  For some operation Z,

    1.  X precedes Z in *program order* and Z precedes Y in *base causality order*, or

    2.  X precedes Z in *base causality order* and Z precedes Y in *program order*, or

    3.  X precedes Z in *base causality order* and Z precedes Y in *base causality order*.

Proxy-preserved base causality order

A memory operation X precedes a memory operation Y in *proxy-preserved base causality order* if X precedes Y in *base causality order*, and:

1.  X and Y are performed to the same address, using the *generic proxy*, or

2.  X and Y are performed to the same address, using the same *proxy*, and by the same thread block, or

3.  X and Y are aliases and there is an alias *proxy fence* along the base causality path from X to Y.

Causality order

*Causality order* combines *base causality order* with some non-transitive relations as follows:

An operation X precedes an operation Y in *causality order* if:

1.  X precedes Y in *proxy-preserved base causality order*, or

2.  For some operation Z, X precedes Z in observation order, and Z precedes Y in *proxy-preserved base causality order*.

¹ The transitivity of *base causality order* accounts for the “cumulativity” of synchronizing operations.

<a id="coherence-order"></a>
### 8.9.6. Coherence Order

There exists a partial transitive order that relates *overlapping* write operations, determined at runtime, called the *coherence order*¹. Two *overlapping* write operations are related in *coherence order* if they are *morally strong* or if they are related in *causality order*. Two *overlapping* writes are unrelated in *coherence order* if they are in a *data-race*, which gives rise to the partial nature of *coherence order*.

¹ *Coherence order* cannot be observed directly since it consists entirely of write operations. It may be observed indirectly by its use in constraining the set of candidate writes that a read operation may read from.

<a id="communication-order"></a>
### 8.9.7. Communication Order

The *communication order* is a non-transitive order, determined at runtime, that relates write operations to other *overlapping* memory operations.

1.  A write W precedes an *overlapping* read R in *communication order* if R returns the value of any byte that was written by W.

2.  A write W precedes a write W’ in *communication order* if W precedes W’ in *coherence order*.

3.  A read R precedes an *overlapping* write W in *communication order* if, for any byte accessed by both R and W, R returns the value written by a write W’ that precedes W in *coherence order*.

*Communication order* captures the visibility of memory operations — when a memory operation X1 precedes a memory operation X2 in *communication order*, X1 is said to be visible to X2.

<a id="axioms"></a>
## 8.10. Axioms

<a id="coherence-axiom"></a>
### 8.10.1. Coherence

If a write W precedes an *overlapping* write W’ in *causality order*, then W must precede W’ in *coherence order*.

<a id="fence-sc-axiom"></a>
### 8.10.2. Fence-SC

*Fence-SC* order cannot contradict *causality order*. For a pair of *morally strong* *fence.sc* operations F1 and F2, if F1 precedes F2 in *causality order*, then F1 must precede F2 in *Fence-SC* order.

<a id="atomicity-axiom"></a>
### 8.10.3. Atomicity

Single-Copy Atomicity

Conflicting *morally strong* operations are performed with *single-copy atomicity*. When a read R and a write W are *morally strong*, then the following two communications cannot both exist in the same execution, for the set of bytes accessed by both R and W:

1.  R reads any byte from W.

2.  R reads any byte from any write W’ which precedes W in *coherence order*.

Atomicity of read-modify-write (RMW) operations

When an *atomic* operation A and a write W *overlap* and are *morally strong*, then the following two communications cannot both exist in the same execution, for the set of bytes accessed by both A and W:

1.  A reads any byte from a write W’ that precedes W in *coherence order*.

2.  A follows W in *coherence order*.

Litmus Test 1

[TABLE]

Atomicity is guaranteed when the operations are *morally strong*.

Litmus Test 2

[TABLE]

Atomicity is not guaranteed if the operations are not *morally strong*.

<a id="no-thin-air-axiom"></a>
### 8.10.4. No Thin Air

Values may not appear “out of thin air”: an execution cannot speculatively produce a value in such a way that the speculation becomes self-satisfying through chains of instruction dependencies and inter-thread communication. This matches both programmer intuition and hardware reality, but is necessary to state explicitly when performing formal analysis.

Litmus Test: Load Buffering with true dependencies

[TABLE]

The litmus test known as “LB+deps” (Load Buffering with dependencies) checks such forbidden values that may arise out of thin air. Two threads T1 and T2 each read from a first variable and copy the observed result into a second variable, with the first and second variable exchanged between the threads. If each variable is initially zero, the final result shall also be zero. If A1 reads from B2 and A2 reads from B1, then values passing through the memory operations in this example form a cycle: A1-\>B1-\>A2-\>B2-\>A1. Only the values x == 0 and y == 0 are allowed to satisfy this cycle. If any of the memory operations in this example were to speculatively associate a different value with the corresponding memory location, then such a speculation would become self-fulfilling, and hence forbidden.

Litmus Test: Load Buffering without dependencies

[TABLE]

This litmus test differs from the one above in that it unconditionally stores 1 to x and y. In this litmus test a final state of x == 1 and y == 1 is permitted. This execution does not contradict the requirement demonstrated by the previous litmus test. Here there is no self-fulfilling cycle – the litmus test will always and unconditionally store 1 to x and y, so here the cycle is not self-fulfilled and the speculation is valid.

Here the lack of dependencies is plain, but the implementation may perform any chain of reasoning to determine that a store is not dependent on a prior load, and thus break self-fulfilling cycles which would otherwise apparently be forbidden by the No-Thin-Air axiom.

This form of load buffering is deliberately permitted in the PTX memory consistency model.

<a id="sc-per-loc-axiom"></a>
### 8.10.5. Sequential Consistency Per Location

Within any set of *overlapping* memory operations that are pairwise *morally strong*, *communication order* cannot contradict *program order*, i.e., a concatenation of *program order* between *overlapping* operations and *morally strong* relations in *communication order* cannot result in a cycle. This ensures that each program slice of *overlapping* pairwise morally *strong operations* is strictly *sequentially-consistent*.

Litmus Test: CoRR

[TABLE]

The litmus test “CoRR” (Coherent Read-Read), demonstrates one consequence of this guarantee. A thread T1 executes a write W1 on a location x, and a thread T2 executes two (or an infinite sequence of) reads R1 and R2 on the same location x. No other writes are executed on x, except the one modelling the initial value. The operations W1, R1 and R2 are pairwise *morally strong*. If R1 reads from W1, then the subsequent read R2 must also observe the same value. If R2 observed the initial value of x instead, then this would form a sequence of *morally-strong* relations R2-\>W1-\>R1 in *communication order* that contradicts the *program order* R1-\>R2 in thread T2. Hence R2 cannot read the initial value of x in such an execution.

### 8.10.6. Causality

Relations in *communication order* cannot contradict *causality order*. This constrains the set of candidate write operations that a read operation may read from:

1.  If a read R precedes an *overlapping* write W in *causality order*, then R cannot read from W.

2.  If a write W precedes an *overlapping* read R in *causality order*, then for any byte accessed by both R and W, R cannot read from any write W’ that precedes W in *coherence order*.

Litmus Test: Message Passing

[TABLE]

The litmus test known as “MP” (Message Passing) represents the essence of typical synchronization algorithms. A vast majority of useful programs can be reduced to sequenced applications of this pattern.

Thread T1 first writes to a data variable and then to a flag variable while a second thread T2 first reads from the flag variable and then from the data variable. The operations on the flag are *morally strong* and the memory operations in each thread are separated by a *fence*, and these *fences* are *morally strong*.

If R1 observes W2, then the release pattern “F1; W2” *synchronizes* with the *acquire pattern* “R1; F2”. This establishes the *causality order* W1 -\> F1 -\> W2 -\> R1 -\> F2 -\> R2. Then axiom *causality* guarantees that R2 cannot read from any write that precedes W1 in *coherence order*. In the absence of any other writes in this example, R2 must read from W1.

Litmus Test: CoWR

[TABLE]

Virtual aliases require an alias *proxy fence* along the synchronization path.

Litmus Test: Store Buffering

The litmus test known as “SB” (Store Buffering) demonstrates the *sequential consistency* enforced by the `fence.sc`. A thread T1 writes to a first variable, and then reads the value of a second variable, while a second thread T2 writes to the second variable and then reads the value of the first variable. The memory operations in each thread are separated by `fence.`sc instructions, and these *fences* are *morally strong*.

[TABLE]

In any execution, either F1 precedes F2 in *Fence-SC* order, or vice versa. If F1 precedes F2 in *Fence-SC* order, then F1 *synchronizes* with F2. This establishes the *causality order* in W1 -\> F1 -\> F2 -\> R2. Axiom *causality* ensures that R2 cannot read from any write that precedes W1 in *coherence order*. In the absence of any other write to that variable, R2 must read from W1. Similarly, in the case where F2 precedes F1 in *Fence-SC* order, R1 must read from W2. If each `fence.sc` in this example were replaced by a `fence.acq_rel` instruction, then this outcome is not guaranteed. There may be an execution where the write from each thread remains unobserved from the other thread, i.e., an execution is possible, where both R1 and R2 return the initial value “0” for variables y and x respectively.

### 8.11.1. Reductions do not form Acquire Patterns

Atomic reduction operations like `red` do not form acquire patterns with acquire fences.

**Litmus Test: Message Passing with a Red Instruction**

[TABLE]

The litmus test known as “MP” (Message Passing) demonstrates the consequence of reductions being excluded from acquire patterns. It is possible to observe the outcome where `R2` reads the value `0` from `x` and `flag` has the final value of `2`. This outcome is possible since the release pattern in `T1` does not synchronize with any acquire pattern in `T2`. Using the `atom` instruction instead of `red` forbids this outcome.
